# add-system-call-in-linux
This is a system call generator in Linux. Instead of you going and changing every where you just run the file and give some inputs. 

To add a system call one can run $python syscall_writer_copy.py
The provide the path of the kernel's source tree.

Note: I have tried it in only Ubuntu.
